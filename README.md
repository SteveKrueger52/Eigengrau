# Eigengrau
PX Group Project, Fall 2020

This is the first 'prototype' in the unfinished state it was in at the original deadline.

The two primary scenes in the study (Assets > _Eigengrau > Scenes > Main > Home & ExampleDrawingScene) are made and 
functional enough for the purposes of our test, but minor work is still needed to link them together along with the 
primary feature we intended for the game as a whole - namely the ability to at runtime replace the textures of the objects
in the Home scene with those you draw in the Art scene.
